# Repository Info

This repository contains work done for my AI & Machine Learning Module Assignment 2 at SP
The scope of the assignment consisted of training supervised regression models to predict time series data of air pollution levels and to submit the best tuned models to a kaggle competition

- `data` contains the train and test datasets for the air pollution levels
- `time_series.ipynb` contains code for the entire modelling process documented with markdown comments
